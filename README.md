# XXFurnace
XXF is a quick-smelt program. Its relatively simple; place your wired modem connected to your turtle, connect your furnace and storage, put the fuel and resources (We use Emendatus Enigmatica's chunks, feel free to change it to iron ore or whatever else) into that chest, connect a monitor, and click a button to start auto-smelting all of that ore.

TL;DR: Smelt things by installing, connecting storage (to a turtle, through wired modems), connecting monitor, and running the program.

install: `COMING SOON`

## Requirements
* We use [Basalt](https://pinestore.cc/projects/15/basalt) for the UI. If you already use it, then use the "NO BASALT" installer. Otherwise, use the regular installer.
* Please, use CC: Tweaked. This program was developed in CC: T, so you will get **NO SUPPORT** if you use the regular CC.
* We don't support CC: Restitched, but it may work. It's untested as of now.
