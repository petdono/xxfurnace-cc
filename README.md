# XXFurnace
XXF is a quick-smelt program. Its relatively simple; place your wired modem connected to your turtle, connect your furnace and storage, put the fuel and resources (We use [Emendatus Enigmatica](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/emendatus-enigmatica)'s chunks, feel free to change it to iron ore or whatever else) into that chest, connect a monitor, and click a button to start auto-smelting all of that ore.

TL;DR: Smelt things by installing, connecting storage (to a turtle, through wired modems), connecting monitor, and running the program.

This will be uploaded to pinestore soon to help support my app and theirs.

## Requirements
* We use [Basalt](https://pinestore.cc/projects/15/basalt) for the UI. If you already use it, then use the "NO BASALT" installer. Otherwise, use the regular installer.
* Please, use CC: Tweaked. This program was developed in CC: T, so you will get **NO SUPPORT** if you use the regular CC.
* We don't support CC: Restitched, but it may work. It's untested as of now.
